                enable the YouTube Data API v3, and generate an API key.

                Set up the API client: Depending on your programming language, you can use libraries like Python, JavaScript, or PHP to interact with the YouTube API. In this example, I'll provide JavaScript code.

                Include the following script tag in your HTML file to load the library:
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Services
